abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become competitive forecasting methods, as most notably shown in the winning method of the recent M4 competition. However, established statistical models such as exponential smoothing (ETS) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but also because they are suitable for non-expert users in that they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.}

    abstract = {Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students. }

Whether you are a financial risk analyst, actuary, regulator or student of quantitative finance, Quantitative Risk Management gives you the practical tools you need to solve real-world problems. Describing the latest advances in the field, Quantitative Risk Management covers the methods for market, credit and operational risk modelling. It places standard industry approaches on a more formal footing and explores key concepts such as loss distributions, risk measures and risk aggregation and allocation principles. The book’s methodology draws on diverse quantitative disciplines, from mathematical finance and statistics to econometrics and actuarial mathematics. A primary theme throughout is the need to satisfactorily address extreme outcomes and the dependence of key risk drivers. Proven in the classroom, the book also covers advanced topics like credit derivatives. Fully revised and expanded to reflect developments in the field since the financial crisis Features shorter chapters to facilitate teaching and learning Provides enhanced coverage of Solvency II and insurance risk management and extended treatment of credit risk, including counterparty credit risk and CDO pricing Includes a new chapter on market risk and new material on risk measures and risk aggregation},

  abstract={Several academics have studied the ability of hybrid models mixing univariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and neural networks to deliver better volatility predictions than purely econometric models. Despite presenting very promising results, the generalization of such models to the multivariate case has yet to be studied. Moreover, very few papers have examined the ability of neural networks to predict the covariance matrix of asset returns, and all use a rather small number of assets, thus not addressing what is known as the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this paper is to investigate the ability of hybrid models, mixing GARCH processes and neural networks, to forecast covariance matrices of asset returns. To do so, we propose a new model, based on multivariate GARCHs that decompose volatility and correlation predictions. The volatilities are here forecast using hybrid neural networks while correlations follow a traditional econometric process. After implementing the models in a minimum variance portfolio framework, our results are as follows. First, the addition of GARCH parameters as inputs is beneficial to the model proposed. Second, the use of one-hot-encoding to help the neural network differentiate between each stock improves the performance. Third, the new model proposed is very promising as it not only outperforms the equally weighted portfolio, but also by a significant margin its econometric counterpart that uses univariate GARCHs to predict the volatilities.},

In a multivariate regression framework, the model is readily interpreted as an extension of the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model allowing for heteroskedasticity. Parameterizing each of the conditional variances as a univariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) process, the descriptive validity of the model is illustrated for a set of five nominal European U.S. dollar exchange rates following the inception of the European Monetary System (EMS). When compared to the pre-EMS free float period, the comovements between the currencies are found to be significantly higher over the later period.},

We show that the problem of multivariate conditional variance estimation can be simplified by estimating univariate GARCH models for each asset, and then, using transformed residuals resulting from the first stage, estimating a conditional correlation estimator. The standard errors for the first stage parameters remain consistent, and only the standard errors for the correlation parameters need be modified. We use the model to estimate the conditional covariance of up to 100 assets using S&P 500 Sector Indices and Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, and conduct specification tests of the estimator using an industry standard benchmark for volatility models. This new estimator demonstrates very strong performance especially considering ease of implementation of the estimator.},

  abstract={In this paper we show how to derive a liquidity adjusted lending value in the case where the collateral is given by a single stock. Following [12] and [7], the collateral market value is adjusted as a function of the position size based on the existence of a one-parameter exponential supply curve. The lending value is then determined as usual, i.e. such that the probability that after a margin call the collateral value falls below the client exposure is at most Ïµ > 0. The curve parameter for a specific stock can be estimated from intraday data by means of a simple regression. Furthermore, we show that an affine model where the liquidity parameter characterizing the exponential supply curve is assumed to be a function of the Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV) has an excellent predictive power. This implies that the ADTV can be used for a simple and direct computation of the liquidity parameter avoiding the use of the intraday data. Concrete examples highlight the impact of liquidity risk on the lending value.},
